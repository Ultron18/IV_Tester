Difference b/w Spice and Python:
1) The probing contacts in the top is different (python has triplet whereas spice has)
2) The bottom point for non isolated config is shorted for V and I
3) The center isolated point is present there in both the case!

In Spice:
1) The difference is visible in isolated and non-isolated when only gold plate value is changed


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes done: [1 iteration for NI is done]
1) Kept the isolated center unchanged for both configs
2) Top plate probing contact is changed
3) The bottom points for V and I are shorted

Yet to:[i.e., for 1st iteration (NI config)]
1) The .net and .sub file for solarcell is created...
2) Has the .net file of FVMI and FIMV. Need to combine the two to make full.net netlist
