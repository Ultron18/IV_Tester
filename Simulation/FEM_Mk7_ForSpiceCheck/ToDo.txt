Tasks for v6:
1) The version should have an automated method to make a combined netlist for solarcell with measurement circuit

2) The circuit will be tested with `Finite` models and simulated with differential probing by the staff... He said I have to do it with his file

2) Put real parameters for busbar, finger and cell currents for 9x9 in LTspice and Python

2) Check the circuitry of Spice for measurement ckt

3) Have to create LTspice sub ckt for isolated back contact from the old version of LTspice

4) Create 5 back contact config to see if there is any observable change


x) Replicate the FF results of Fraunhofer with top contact for paper


Hardware:
1) Check the XIAO board	--> power supply to the board
		       	--> connectivity
2) ADS1115 test
3) MPC3745 test
Claim: the modules works when connected separately but not together in one I2C bus with different addresses
[WORKED] - Issue was with the capacitance of Breadboard
