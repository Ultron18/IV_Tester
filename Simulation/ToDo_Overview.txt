v6:
1) Automated netlist writer
2) Display patters for Voltage and current plots

v7:
1) Use 9x9 configuration and make to similar to LTSpice model
2) Compare the results with Spice model

Spice:
1) Change measurement ckt to the one used in Python
2) Properly look into the probing configuration


Immediate work: Spice-1,2 ; v6-1 ; v7-1,2 ; v6-2


Inferences:
Are we getting the same results through LTspice and pyLTspice???
